GINSUTALK !  "The Chat Software For the GODS"

 Run the self-extracting EXE file, it will create a directory UNDER
 your current directory which will contain all the Gtalk files.

 If you have not already done so, you will need to configure your serial
 ports, <not necessary on console only versions> and call GTalk
 developers to get a validation code which will activate your copy of
 GTALK..

 AFTER you have done this.
 ------------------------------------------

 Login to the chat with the following information:


Use Account: 0
   Password: Password

AS SOON AS YOU LOGIN, type

/system

enter (P) at the menu,

set your system Passwords:

  MASTER password : This is required to edit user number < 5
                      to CHANGE any other system password
                      to make a user a CO or a SYSOP

  USER EDIT       : This is required to enter the user editor

  COMMAND TOGGLE  : This is required to use the /command utility.
                    The /command utility will let you disble commands
                    on a SYSTEM wide basis.

  CONSOLE PAGE    : Will allow you to set the password required to
                    toggle console paging on or off.


 AFTER setting passwords, choose (C) from the /system menu to set your
 system name. There is a utility included to set the number of calls
 your system has recieved, this is provided to allow you to restore
 the number of calls if you have a serious hardware failure.

  (the statistics are SAVED even if there is a system crash or powerdown,
   unlike the memory based Ddial, there is no need to restore them in
   case of these events)

This system name appears in the REMOTE /s lists that other systems will
see when you are linked.


------------------------------------------------

Type /passwd

and reset the Sysop Password, then see newuser.doc, on creating users,
and bbs.doc on creating new bulliten boards.

------------------------------------------------
NOW.... LOG OUT, and back in...

type /q (or /rl0) and log back in to check that your new password works.

YOU MUST LOG OUT, or your new password will not be saved.

------------------------------------------------
from console you may type "/quick" to shutdown the system quickly during
configuration.

THIS WILL ONLY WORK FROM CONSOLE.

you can type /shutdown from ANY node. Be warned though, /shutdown *WILL*
reboot your computer, so make sure you have a autoexec file setup to
execute the following:

 cd <gtalk directory>
 gtalk.exe

Happy Chatting!
