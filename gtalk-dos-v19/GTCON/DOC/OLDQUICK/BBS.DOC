BBS DOC FILE     March 1993   - David W Jeske

Quick and Dirty.

To Create a New BBS Board, create a directory in the BBS subdirectory
under the main GinsuTalk directory. This name should be in the convention

  BBS###    where ### is the board number with leading 0s

The software ships with BBS\BBS001 created.

There is a file called DESCRIPT inside every BBS### directory. This file
configures the maximum number of messages in the Board, the Priv number
required to empty the board, the User Number who moderates the board, and
the NAME of the board.

Sample DESCRIPT  file
------------------------------------------------------
50
0
100
Main

------------------------------------------------------
<end of sample file>

50   = The Max number of messages in the board
0    = the Priv(flag) required to enter the bbs board
100  = the user number who moderates this BBS
Main = the NAME of the bbs



Create a DESCRIPT file in your new BBS directory.

To have this new board appear in the (J)ump command, edit the file

MENU\BOARDS.MNU

MENU\BOARDS.ANS will print as a FULL SCREEN ANSI file to those
who wish to see FULL screen ANSI (if the file exists)


YOUR DONE!
