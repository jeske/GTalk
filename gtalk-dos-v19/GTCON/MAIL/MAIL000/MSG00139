    You have just chosen to purchase what we feel is the best solution for
|*f3multi-user interactive conferencing software|*r1. We hope that, as you become
more and more familiar with the software, that your expectations are fulfilled.
GinsuTalk was designed to combine ease of use, with high power and flexibility.
This software is designed to handle large numbers of high speed data lines
with less powerful hardware than any software product of it's kind.

|*f6|*h1GinsuTalk currently supports the following serial boards:|*r1

   Standard AT I/O ports (COM ports)
   |*f4Digiboard|*r1 PC/X "Dumb" 16450 and 16500 MultiPort Boards

   |*f4Digiboard|*r1 PC/X|*f1i|*r1 "Inteligent" MultiPort Boards
     - Using Digiboard intelligent boards is the best
       solution for high speed data lines on the extreme
       minimum of computer hardware.

SOON to be supported:

   |*f4BOCA|*r1 series 16450 and 16550 based boards (4 and 8 port boards
       are available) - These boards provide limited flexibility
       but are extremely economical.
