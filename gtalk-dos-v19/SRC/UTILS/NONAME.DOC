What happened was this: Some one wanted to see some of the .TXTs, so I brought
one to school, for him to read, but someone else wanted it, so they were
fighting over it when Ms. Musker asked me for it, as she was asking for it, I
started to rip it up, she took it from me, she then taped it back together
(which I wished she hadn't).  After reading it, she said she was going to have
Ms. Svhiela <--whatever!)  read it.  So I was called down to the office, and
Ms. Sviehla <--whatever!) said I couldn't go home until my mom read it (and
you know how my mom is!) so I had to watch my mom read it in front of me. 
(that was the worst!)  So I was given a punishment from Ms. <you know> and my
mom.  Ms what's-her-face said I have to clean up around the school grounds
picking up junks, and my mom (and dad) said that I'm gonna have to trap City
Limits so they can bust him.  And I can't call anywhere without having my
parents know who the SysOp is by talking to him (or her) over th
e phone. 
Doesn't that fuckin' suck?!?!?!?!?!?!  Right now I'm on, because my parents
aren't home, but I'll be getting off soon so they don't catch me.  And another
punishment received from parents is that I have to move my room out of the
basement and switch with my sisters room upstairs...away from the computer. :(
Welp, there you have it, oh! and another thing, I might even have to go to
court since it a federal case (the files crossed over state lines).  So, now
that you know about my life story...I hope you're satisfied!
