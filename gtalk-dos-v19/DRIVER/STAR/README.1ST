ACL Software  Ver. 3.10

The ACL Software has been updated to implement enhancements.  This README.1ST
file contains descriptions of the updates to the programs.  Further 
information on the ACL Software is provided in ACL User's manual Chapters 4 & 
5.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACLOS.EXE  ACL Operating System  Ver. 3.10

The following options have been added to the control blocks.  Further 
information on the control block structure is provided in ACL User's manual 
pages 5-4 to 5-14.


Parity Type (R/W)
     Defines the type of parity desired for the channel.  Parameters are 
     defined as follows:

     0000H     No Parity      0001H     Even Parity
     0002H     Odd Parity     0003H     Force Parity Space
     0004H     Force Parity Mark


Line Protocol (R/W)
     Defines the line protocol used for the UART.  Parameters are defined as 
     follows:

     0000H     None           0001H     XON/XOFF
     0002H     CTS/RTS        0003H     Modem Control (Handshake & CTS/RTS)
     0004H     Handshake      0005H     Handshake & XON/XOFF

     Handshake protocol provides control of the DTR output and the ability to
     read the status of DSR, DCD and RI.  It also allows break to be 
     transmitted.

     The DTR output is activated by setting bit 0 of the upper byte of the 
     Modem Control/Status word to Logic 1.  Break is transmitted by setting 
     bit 4 of the same byte to Logic 1.	 Status of the DSR, DCD and RI lines
     is read in the lower byte of the Modem Control/Status word.

     Handshake & XON/XOFF protocol provides XON/XOFF protocol in conjunction 
     with handshake protocol.


Modem Control/Status (R/W)
     This word is divided into two bytes.  The upper byte is the control byte 
     and the lower byte is the status byte.  The definition of each bit 
     appears below:

     Control Byte (R/W)

     Bit  Signal

     0    DTR       (0 = Off, 1 = On)
     1-3  Reserved  (not used)
     4    Break     (0 = Off, 1 = On)
     5-7  Reserved  (not used)

     Status Byte (R)

     Bit  Signal
     
     0    DSR       (0 = Off, 1 = On)
     1    DCD       (0 = Off, 1 = On)
     2    RI        (0 = Off, 1 = On)
     3-7  Reserved  (not used)


Configuration Status (R/W)
     Setting this word to 0001H alerts the ACL Operating System that one or 
     more configuration parameters have been changed.  The ACL Operating 
     System will then reconfigure the channel using the new parameters and 
     write a 0000H into this location.	Reconfiguring a channel does not 
     reset the pointers if the buffer sizes remain the same.  If the buffer 
     sizes change, all pointers on all channels are reset.  

     Setting this word to 0002H resets the pointers on this channel only.

     Setting this word to 0003H reconfigures the channel and resets the 
     pointers on this channel only.  If the buffer sizes change, all pointers 
     on all channels are reset.


Channel Status (R/W)
     This word is used to report configuration errors and communication 
     errors.  Error codes are listed below:

     Configuration Errors

     0000H     No Error
     0001H     Invalid Channel
     0002H     Invalid Mode
     0003H     Invalid Baud Rate
     0004H     Invalid Number Of Bits Per Character
     0005H     Invalid Number Of Stop Bits
     0006H     Invalid Parity Type
     0007H     Invalid Protocol
     0008H     Invalid Auto Echo Flag
     0009H     Invalid Input Buffer Size
     000AH     Invalid Output Buffer Size
     000BH     Invalid Interrupt Rate
     000CH     Non-functional UART

     Communication Errors

     0100H     Framing Error
     0101H     Parity Error
     0102H     Overrun Error
     0200H     Break Received


Default Buffer Size
     The default buffer size is 992 bytes with a 16k Daul Port Memory and 
     4064 bytes with a 64k Dual Port Memory.


Input Buffer
     The input buffer will not overrun if too many characters are received.
     An overrun error is reported in the Channel Status Word when the input
     buffer and the UART FIFO are both full.  Also, if CTS/RTS protocol is in
     effect, RTS will be dropped when the input buffer and the UART FIFO are 
     both full.

ACLMODE.EXE  ACL Mode  Ver. 3.10

The following options have been added to the ACLMODE command.  Further 
information on the ACLMODE command is provided in ACL User's manual pages 4-4
to 4-5.


parity         Either N (none), O (odd), E (even), M (mark) or S (space)
               (default = N)


line protocol  Either N (none), X (XON/XOFF), C (CTS/RTS), M (modem control),
               H (handshake) or B (both handshake & XON/XOFF)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DL.EXE  ACL Download  Ver. 3.10

The ACL Download program now resets the ACL board.  This eliminates the need 
to use the ACLRESET command before using the DL command.  The ACL Operating 
System can be downloaded by typing the following command:

	A>DL ACLOS.EXE

Further information on the ACL Download program is provided in ACL User's 
manual pages 4-1 to 4-4.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACLCCP.EXE  ACL Communication Control Program  Ver. 3.10

The ACLCCP command is a new program that downloads the ACL Operating System.
This command eliminates the need to specify a filename to be downloaded.  To 
download the ACL Operating System, type the following command:

	A>ACLCCP

This will reset the ACL board and download the ACL Operating System.

The ACLCCP program uses the same environment variables as the DL command.
Further information on the environment variables is provided in ACL User's 
manual page 4-2.
