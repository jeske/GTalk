This document describes the procedures and information necessary to use
the Special Character Interrupt features of the DigiBoard XAPCM232 DOS Driver
(V 1.9.1).


The driver has been enhanced to handle Special Character Interrupts (SCI) from
the Digiboard. The modifications provide for a Special Character Flag (SCF) and
a Special Character Count (SCC) for each channel supported by the driver.

Interrupt 14h functions 19h (Enable/Disable Special Character interrupts) and
and 1ah (Get pointer to Special Character Flag/Count) have been added to
facilitate easy use of these features.


The Special Character Flag :

The SCF is a byte location for each channel and has two possible values :

		00h - No Special Characters in the channel's
		      receive buffer.

 		FFh - Special Character(s) in the channel's
		      receive buffer.

The driver will set the SCF to FFh on each SCI and reset it to 00h only after
the last received Special Character has been retrieved from the buffer, or the
buffer has been flushed.



The Special Character Count :

The SCC is a word location for each channel and specifies the number of characters
in the receive buffer, up to and including the last received Special Character.
( Note that the SCC is NOT a count of the Special Characters in the buffer, but
a count of all characters in the buffer, up to and including the last received
Special Character.) The SCC is valid only when the SCF is set to FFh. The SCC
is calculated each time a SCI occurs and is decremented each time a character
is read from the channel's receive buffer. The SCC is set to 0 if the buffer is
flushed or the last Special Character is read from the buffer. The SCC permits
easy use of INT 14h function 0Fh, the read string function, which requires that
the user specify the number of bytes to read.



Enabling SC Interrupts :


As mentioned earlier, each channel must have it's SCI's enabled. To do this,
you can use the DOS driver INT 14h function 19h (Enable/Disable Special
Character Interrupts). This function has the following usage :


FNCT 19H - ENABLE / DISABLE  SPECIAL CHARACTER INTERRUPT

	   ENTRY     AH : 19H
		     BL : 0    - DISABLE SPECIAL CHARACTER INTERRUPT
		     BH : 0FFH - ENABLE SPECIAL CHARACTER INTERRUPT
		     DX : ANY CHANNEL NUMBER SUPPORTED BY THE DRIVER

	   RETURNS   AH : 0    - FUNCTION GOOD
		     AL : 0FFH - FUNCTION FAILED


Enabling the SCI for each channel will allow the SCFs and SCCs to provide
accurate information.





Locating the SCFs and the SCCs :


The SCFs and the SCCs are located in the driver's memory space and can be
located using the driver's Interrupt 14h function 1Ah. The function usage
is shown below :


FNCT 1AH - GET POINTER TO SPECIAL CHARACTER FLAG/COUNTER

	   ENTRY     AH : 1AH
		     BX : 0 - RETURN POINTER TO SPECIAL CHARACTER FLAG (BYTE)
		     BX : 1 - RETURN POINTER TO SPECIAL CHARACTER COUNTER (WORD)
		     DX : ANY CHANNEL NUMBER SUPPORTED BY THE DRIVER.

	   RETURNS   ES : BX - POINTS TO THE FLAG OR COUNTER.

	   NOTE : SPECIAL CHARACTER INTERRUPTS MUST BE ENABLED FOR THE
		  FLAGS AND COUNTERS TO PROVIDE VALID INFORMATION.

	   FLAG  = FFh if a Special Character is in the receive buffer.
		 = 0   No Special Character in buffer; count is invalid.

	   COUNT = The number of characters in the receive buffer, up to
		   and including the last received Special Character. This
		   count is not valid if the Special Character Flag is 0.

Typically, the application would get pointers to a channel's flag and count,
and monitor the flag until it changes from 0 to 0FFh. At this time, the
application could issue an interrupt 14h function 0FH call (read string) to
read the number of characters specfied by the count value.
