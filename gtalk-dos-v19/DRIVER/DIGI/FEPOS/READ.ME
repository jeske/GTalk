        The files in this directory relate to the on-board software
        provided for the DigiCHANNEL PC/Xx by DigiBoard, Inc.

        PCXXSPEC.TXT    This specification covers the BIOS & FEPOS programs.
                        The BIOS is used for the power-up and post diagnostics.
                        It also explains how to exit the BIOS and begin 
                        execution of downloaded code.  The BIOS resides in
                        EPROM for the PC/Xm (EPROM version 1.5 for rev 'A' 
                        boards & 2.3 for rev 'B' boards).  The BIOS is a 2K
                        binary file that is downloaded to dual-ported memory
                        on the PC/Xe or PC/Xi, version 3.5.  This specification
                        also covers the Front End Processor Operating System,
                        FEPOS. This code is the supplied on-board operating 
                        system, FEPOS version 4.7.
        XABIOS.OBJ      Assembled 2K BIOS (MASM 4.0).
        XABIOS.BIN      Binary file for the 2K downloadable BIOS (EXE2BIN).
        XAFEP.OBJ       Assembled module for the FEPOS (MASM 4.0).
        XAFEP.BIN       Binary file for the FEPOS (EXE2BIN).  CONVERT.COM can 
                        be used to make this a downloadable module that can be
                        executed via a BIOS function 1.
        CONVERT.COM     Takes the existing XAFEP.BIN file and inserts the 
                        number of 256 byte blocks in byte 2 and a 2's 
                        compliment CRC in byte 3.  This program will create a 
                        new file, XAFEP.FCM.  XAFEP.FCM file can now be 
                        downloaded to the DigiCHANNEL PC/Xx, followed by a
                        BIOS function 1 to transfer control from the BIOS to 
                        the downloaded program (FEPOS).  Refer to PCXXSPEC.TXT
                        for more details on creating the downloadable program.
