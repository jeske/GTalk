********************************
*  Kernel/Serial Info Commands *
********************************

 /CHK            The CHecKsum Command allow users to utilize GTalk's self
                 checksum utilities.

                 /CHK *
                    Will tell the system to do an immediate checksum
                    of the "program" in RAM. NOTE: This is a background task
                    so output may not appear immediately. When the checksum is
                    finished, both the INITIAL checksum of the program RAM
                    (which was taken when the system started up) and the
                    CURRENT checksum of the program RAM are printed. If they
                    differ, Rebooting of the system is suggested, for the
                    integrity of the program has been breeched.

                 /CHK+  or /CHK-
                    Will ENABLE or DISABLE the operation of the AUTOMATIC
                    checksum.

                    If enabled, this will checksum the Program in RAM every
                    minute. If they checksum fails. It will alert all users.
                    Log an error to the file <gtalk>\LOG\ERROR.LOG and
                    reboot the system.

                 /CHK
                    Will print whether the above AUTO-checksum feature is
                    currently enabled.

                 NOTE: the auto-checksum feature saves to the system
                       information file. So if it is enabled, it will
                       continue to be enabled when the system is shutdown
                       and restarted. Until the /CHK- command is executed.

/MEMORY         The /MEMORY command prints a detailed memory map of
                GTalk memory. It will print the amount of memory allocated
                to DOS, as well as the amount of memory GTalk is using itself.

                 - Spaces marked as EMPTY are available for allocation.

                 - The DOS CoreLeft should be around 32k, that is memory left
                   for dos C functions to allocate from.

/FILES          The /FILES command prints a detailed map of the files which
                are currently open.

                   NOTE: files are not usually left open very long, so this
                         list is usually empty. Files which are being Xferred
                         are usually open for an extended period of time, and
                         thus can been seen while the Xfer is in progress.

/SCHED          The /SCHED command prints a detailed map of events which are
                currently scheduled. These tasks are NOT running, they are
                WAITING to be run. When they are actually run, they no longer
                appear in this list.

/SERIAL         The /SERIAL command prints a list of the currently installed
                serial devices. No serial configuration data can be modified
                from withen the GTalk program.
                    - See the program SERIALCF.EXE

/DCD            The /DCD command toggles the use of the Data Carrier Detect
                line for a specific Node. This should be left alone in
                normal situations.

                Initially DCD detect is set to ON.

                /DCD<line>
                   Will toggle the DCD detect for that line. The main use of
                   this command is to allow NULL MODEM connections to specific
                   lines. if /DCD<line> and that line is connected to a modem
                   GTalk will no longer realize which someone Hangs Up on the
                   modem. (The Gtalk program will think there is ALWAYS DCD)

                 NOTE: Currently, to log into another node you must set the
                       baud rate to the configured baud rate, and type
                       CON <baud><return>.

                        Ex. CON 2400<return>

/QUICK          This feature is available from CONSOLE only. Console cannot
                be forced to issue this command in any way.

                This command does an IMMEDIATE drop to DOS. It does not
                deallocate anything, or deinit the serial ports. This
                feature is currently for debugging purposes only and will
                be removed. It may be initially "disabled" in the /command
                menu. When configuring the system, this is the quickest
                way to exit the software, and should have no ill-effects
                other than, the modems will be left at auto-answer.

/SHUTDOWN       This command will de-init all modems with the "de-init string"
                which was preconfigured in the SERIAL.CFG. Normally this
                is set for "ats0=0" to set the modem to no longer answer.

                It will carefully close all files, and kill all processes.
                Then it will automatically  ** REBOOT YOUR COMPUTER **.

                <note, this command will soon ask for a shutdown password,
                 which can be set via the <P>assword section of the /SYSTEM
                 menu.

/RESET<task#>   This command will blindly KILL the task at the specified
                task number. Note that each port's number is the same
                as it's task number. This command is also provided as a
                debug utility, and should not be used for general purposes.
                Use /K<line> instead. <This will not save the information
                of the user logged into the node.>

                USAGE: if a modem needs to be reset and there is NO USER
                       on that line. /RESET<line> will hang-up and re-init
                       the modem.

                       If you add a modem to an active serial port, it should
                       automatically be initted when it is turned on. If it
                       is not initted, switch it off, count to 2 and switch
                       it back on. If this still does not re-init the modem.
                       type /reset<line>. If THAT does not init the modem,
                       something is wrong with either the SERIAL.CFG or
                       the line the modem is connected to.

/SYSTEM         This menu is the Easiest entry to the sysop utilities.
                It has menu entries for all of the following functions:

                        /SYSOP          - sysop file utilities
                        /EF             - File Editor
                        /VIEW           - File Viewer
                        /U              - User Editor

               From this menu you may enter  "U###" where ### is the
               user number you wish to edit or create.
