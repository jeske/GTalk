*******************
*    BBS FILES    *
*  <gtalk>\bbs    *
*******************

Boards List:   boards.lst  <Jump, then ?, from the BBS menu>

     Each BBS Directory (<gtalk>\BBS\BBSxxx, where xxx is the board number)
has a file in it called the "DESCRIPT" file which defines the characteristics
and name of the BBS. The format of the DESCRIPT file follows.

******* SAMPLE <gtalk>\BBS\BBS001\DESCRIPT  file ********************
50
0
100
Main

******* END OF SAMPLE FILE ******************************************

50   = The Max number of messages in the board
0    = the Priv(flag) required to enter the bbs board
100  = the user number who moderates this BBS
Main = the NAME of the bbs

     To create a new Bulliten Board, simply create the next successive
directory. (Ex. <gtalk>\BBS\BBS002 ) and in that directory create a new
DESCRIPT file with the format from above. This new base will NOT automatically
be added to the <gtalk>\BBS\BOARDS.LST file so you must add it manually.
(this is done to let sysops make custom color, and full screen ANSI
board lists)


***********************
*      /m  FILES      *
*   <gtalk>\ROTATOR   *
***********************

    The format of the /m files is unpublished. Basically, each is given a name
of the format ROTxxx where xxx is the box number. There is a file ROTATOR.N
which holds the ownership and properties of /m boxes. This file is edited
by Gtalk in the /rot utiltity, and the user should not attempt to alter it.
If the file becomes corrupted, (due to HD crash or othewise) simply delete it.


***********************
*    SYSHELP FILES    *
*   <gtalk>\SYSHELP   *
***********************

    The names of files in the /syshelp online help utility are defined by
the file: <gtalk>\SYSHELP\FILE.LST. A sample FILE.LST follows

******** SAMPLE  <gtalk>\SYSHELP\FILE.LST  **********************
RULES.TXT
System Rules
HELP.TXT
Verbose Help File
PAYMENT.TXT
Payment Information
******** END OF SAMPLE *******************************************

the files which appear on the odd lines are the names of the files which
SHOULD BE LOCATED IN THE <gtalk>\SYSHELP directory. Gtalk will contruct a
menu based on the names on the EVEN lines. Ex.


------- Sample GTalk Output --------------------------------------

GinsuTalk System Help Library

1. System Rules
2. Verbose Help File
3. Payment Information
P. Toggle Paging On/off (default=on)

Which file to read: (1-3,P,Q,?):

------- End of SAMPLE --------------------------------------------

If a user selects (1), the System Rules file, if the above FILE.LST sample
file were in use. The file <gtalk>\SYSHELP\RULES.TXT would be printed.



*********************
*    USERS FILES    *
*   <gtalk>\USERS   *
*********************

Files :
        SYSMBR.LST
        MEMBER.LST
        MEMBER.HDR
        SYSMBR.HDR


The files in the USERS directory are related to the /sm and /sm+ commands

/sm is the System Member List command for USERS
/sm+ is the System Member List command for sysops.

 The /sm command prints the file MEMBER.LST withen the USERS directory. This
file (like the SYSMBR.LST file) is automatically created/updated by GTalk every
morning at 6am. The file can be manually updated with the /memud command.
(NOTE: the updating of these files is a background process, so it takes
       several moments after the /MEMUD command is completed before
       the files will actually be updated. If you are monitoring Channel 0
       Messages as to the progress of the update will be printed.)

 The /sm+ command prints the file SYSMBR.LST.

The two header files in the USERS directory are printed at the top of the
/sm or /sm+ output.


**********************
*    CONFIG FILES    *
*   <gtalk>\CONFIG   *
**********************

The <gtalk>\CONFIG Directory contains the SERIALCF.EXE program. This program
is SEVERLY ALPHA. This does not mean it will crash or not work. Just that
it has a severly user UNfriendly interface. Try and write down all the serial
configuration information on paper before you have to enter it into the
utility.

 Your Gtalk software release should come with a PRE-made SERIAL.CFG file. If
this file does not exist in the <gtalk> directory DCFG Enterprises will
create one for you. Contact them at the address available in the title
pages.

  NOTE: this serial configuration utility will soon be replaced, please bear
  with us. Serial Configuration only has to be done once.



**********************
*    SYSTEM FILES    *
*   <gtalk>\SYSTEM   *
**********************

  The SYSTEM directory contains a few files which are used to create or list
the USER.DAT file.

  Note: source for these utilities is included so that those proficient in
        a programming language can create their own general use programs
        which can read/write the user.dat.

     DCFG Enterprises will assume NO responsibility for damage which
     occurs from the User file Source provided. For more disclamer information
     see the source code files themselves.


********************
*    MAIL FILES    *
*   <gtalk>\MAIL   *
********************

    The users mail is stored under the <gtalk>\MAIL directory. Each user
is given a directory called MAILxxx where xxx is that users number.

the mail for user number 000 would be available in the directory

<gtalk>\MAIL\MAIL000

At this time, the mail files are unencrypted.

 The structure of the actual mail system, and the mail files are being
 redesigned as of this Documemtation press time.

   The new mail system will have optionally encrypted files (sysops discrecion)
 and a new /mail structure which is easier to use.
