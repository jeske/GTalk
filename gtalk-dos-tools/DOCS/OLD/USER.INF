                channel is locked, you will not be moved.

                When you move from channel to channel, all the users on
                the channels you move from and to will see messages announcing
                your leaving and arrival.

                For a full description of channel properties, see the channel
                moderator section at the end of this document.

 Send Channel Message

 /Cc<message>   This command sends <message> to channel c. This is usefull
                for when you are monitoring a channel you are not on, and
                wish to repily to a statement on that channel.

                Ex.

                NOTE: channel messages are not currently sent over ddial links
                      on that channel. This is usefull to print LOCAL messages
                      to your system. (soon there will be /ps)

                           (see User Account Information Doc)
                        -  if the [+] argument was added, you will see a
                           verbose list of ALL the command names you can

                This command is especially powerfull. It allows users to
                monitor the messages on channels which they are not actually
                "tuned" to.

/MON            This will print the channels you are currently monitoring.

                NOTE: this will remove any other channels in your monitor
                      list <exception = t0 for sysops with /sysmon ON, see

                 COMMAND DOCS: /sysmon>



****************
*    /PAGE     *
****************

/PAGE<line>     This allows you to PAGE the user on line #<line>. He will
                receive a message indicating who paged him, and 5 Control-Gs.
                NOTE: the control-Gs will be printed NO MATTER WHERE HE IS
                      IN THE SYSTEM. The message will only be printed when
                      he is at a prompt, or at the main level.

/PAGE(+,-)      This allows a user to toggle paging on or off. Users who
                /page a node who has paging off will get a "Refusing Pages"
                message. NOTE: This saves to the user file, so it will
                               remain set as it was when you were last
                               online.

                               
******************
*    /PASSWD     *

                option) a guest.

                A silenced user or guest will not be able to say anything,
                or change his handle. If somone is causing trouble, a user
                may silence him. Any user may then unsilence him whenever
                they like.

/US<line>       This command has the same function as /SI<line>-, but will
                soon be removed from the system.
