I. Decide on and Create a gtalk directory. Something like \GTALK will
   do just fine.

     Type:   cd \
             mkdir \GTALK


II.  UNCOMPRESS THE Distribution

   A. GTFILES.EXE   - a self extracting archive. Simply copy the
                      archive into the directory you created in (I)
                      and type "GTFILES<return>". It will ask
                      if you want to create a directory, type "A" for
                      always.

   B. GTK<xx>.EXE   - a self extracting archive. Simply copy the file
                      into your gtalk directory which you created in
                      (I). Then execute the filename. It will self-extract.

                      This is the actual Gtalk executable file.

   C. Copy the file grun.bat to the root directory with the command

         copy grun.bat \

      then, with your favorite editor, edit the grun file, and substitute
      the name of the Gtalk directory you created in (I) for the command
       "cd \gtalk" in the batch file.

       <When you have completely set up your GTalk system, and have it
        online, you will want to put "grun" as the LAST line of your
        AUTOEXEC.BAT file.>

   D. Make sure you are in the GTalk directory (which will later be
      referred to as <gtalk>) and type "GTALK"

      The program will run, and stop. You then have to call DCFG Enterprises
      and they will activate your copy of gtalk.

III. Set the Passwords!!!

   A. run "gtalk". Press return to bring up a login prompt.

      Login into account number 0, and masterbate all over the keyboard.
      Next,
