      FUCKED, the string table is too BIG

       FIX IT


gt17a5
      - YEAH! we fixed it.. we also set up the makefile
        for easy removal of unwanted warnings (i.e. ptr conversions,
         code w/no effect)

      OK... string table is fixed, but there are some problems with
      the software which is running (1.7a3 crashed)


   <COPY PROTECTION could be placed in the wrong version,
     it may have been added earlier>
      - COPY PROTECTION is fully implemented
        Now, #define COPY_PROTECTION_ON in task.c
        turns on/off copy protection.
         - SOFTWARE VERSION NUMBER is now in the
           "composite checksum" that user reads to us
           (rom.c updated)


      - removed the log_error() in BBS which fills the log files
      - set compiler linker flags for better optimization

gt17a6
      - EVERYTHING now uses precompiled headers (for more speedy compile)
      - actions and /f<node><message> now print

        the priv can see WHO typed the command

gt17a7
      - COSMETIC/BUG changes only

gt17a8
      - redid /sp (consider making a /sp system name different from

   NEED: /system (C) needs to PRINT the system name
       : FIX legnth of SYSTEM NAME IN task.c startup
      - fixed /suspend (works now)
      - fixed (changed ) squelch

LAST TWO VERSIONS< SHUTDOWN (save sys info) WAS FUCKED (worked fine here,

gt18a1.arj
      - filter_ansi now removes ^s also so guests can't login with
        them in their handles

        - intelligent digiboard support
        - loading from configuration file
        - .ANS extention for FULL SCREEN ANSI stuff
     - DUMB DIGIBOARD BROKEN!!!


gt18a2
      - FIXED THE DUMB DIGIBOARD (was actually a confuration/bug)
         - now the digiboards will not even TRY to use digi ports
           which have not been configured.. so it wont fuckup.
           (if digi_XX_interrupt sees that a port is indexed
            by the digiboard which has a null strucure... it
            just returns and loses the character. )

      - /ds - double space installed
      - /si-   (conforms to normal command standard)
      - /t<channel>-<link node> to move links
      - System #, Name, and software version
        in /sysinfo
      - Login Node [XX] at <YYY> will print extended result codes


gt1.8a3
      - Links can no longer be "kicked" they must be "moved" with
        /t<channel>-<link_node>
      - Link channels will reset if you leave the link alone on them
        but PRIORITY lock will not reset
      - MOVED mail and other messages in login from BEFORE to AFTER
        the xxxLIN.TXT file
      - gt.c (init_login_vars) replaced 2 "tswitch"s with "portnum"
        to fix /f/lurk(+,-) so it resets the correct persons time.

gt1.8a4
      - BUG : it will lockup at the BEGINNING of a typed line,
              assuming the problem s with get_first_char stuff

      - get_first_char modified to read HEAD and TAIL first and
        then do comparisons
      - char_in_buf(int node) is fixed, there was a bug before
      - main_loop() uses char_in_buf to tell if the person has
        typed anything, hoping to fix lockup temporarily
      - aligned the header stuff in BBS posts
      - there was a %d should have been %u for the TIME in /sl
      - there was a bug from the link/channel stuff that made users
        not lose channel mod when they moved around after getting it
      - some additional security, passwords for /sysop and /system
        and logging of bad pw's, xfers, etc.

gt1.8b1
      - VIRTUAL CONSOLES!@#!@#!@#
        YES!
gt1.8b2
      - CONSOLE HAS ANSI

gt1.8b3
      - killstats.kills_total and killedstats.kills_total are now
        working. And are printed in /info
      - set up editor to work for CURRENT width
         NOTE: HUGE BUGS IN THIS WE FOUND LATER
               SEE gt1.8b5
      - /SLOW
      - Ddial Link protocal now sends one line login and logoff messages
      - COOL BANNER THING

   BUG: dcd_state for digiboard ports is UNKNOWN at the beginning
        because it has not sent us any interrupts.
      FIX: we need to send the circular command buffer a command
           to tell us the DCD state of each configured intelligent
           port.

gt1.8b4
     - /k log installed </log k or /log2k or /log -k>
     - ANSI on console improved , approaching vt102
     - put back / commands at hotkey prompts which were lost
       before

gt1.8b5
     - WOW: big bug in the editor variable width stuff, needed to
       allocate bigger S pointers. FIXED (we hope)
     - checksum stuff works GREAT now
       (redid with new checksum stuff, so there is a COMPOSITE
        *AND* a VERIFICATION CODE so we can tell what their rom
        checksum is.)
     - created and fixed bug in loading of editor files
     - keyboard and 8250 routines separated

gt1.8b6  4/11/93
     - fixed bug from a LONG time ago in com.c where an 8250
       routine did NOT re "enable()" interrupts

gt1.8b7 4/12/93 **** LAST NON-EMS VERSION ****
     - fixed /k log "corpse has wrong user number"
     - If you try to get too many VCs then it will
       *NOT* crash, it will just make the extras inactive.


**************** EMS VERSIONS ********************

gt19emsc

     - EMS support added only for EMS 4.0. look_for_mem allocates
       it, next_task, and int8_task_switch totally revamped to
       handle switching the stack out from under the task switching
       the stack. make_task and multitask also updated for it.
       alloc structures changed to accomodate ownership of EMS pages
     - int8 task switching was fucked because of swap of oldss, and oldsp
     - 8250 send_char routine fixed (no enable)

gt19emsd(ems)  4/11/93
     - Operating system detect stuff added and put in INIT.C
       - (auto chooses a DIFFERENT int8_task_switch
          for DesqView)

gt19emse 4/13/93        **** FIRST VERSION OF _ONLY_ EMS ****
                        <no more NON-EMS versions will be updated >
     - Rearranged EMS stuff to put DOS+OS/2 test first.
     - made "g_exit(int return_code)" so you can exit and it WILL
       deallocate resources.
     - Corpse user number in /k log was screwed, FIXED
     - fixed bug in ALLOC (look_for_ems had a return w/no value)
     - Now, if the #VCs configured> #VCs available, then it will
       *NOT* fuckup, it will just make the other ones inactive.
     TASKER:
        - put int8_task_switch back to it's true form
          (i.e. if (cur_task_struct == end_task_struct)  )
        - put back "outp(0x20,0x20);" in the end of
          int8_task_switch. NOTE: this may cause problems and has
          *NOT* been tested.
     - /l<node> (commands to links) worked on.. VERY functional now
     - /p highlight
     - links full duplex
     - REMOTE UPDATES works!!! yeah!
     - SYSTEM LOAD stuff in task.c

gt19emsf 4/18/93
     - REMOVED outp(0x20,0x20); as possible cause of problems on the
       chat at home.
     - fixed bug in /term
        ( it would lock_dos(); then kill_task(); and if the task was
          "wait_for_death" on, then it would NEVER get to finish, becuase
           dos was locked.
    - HUGE EMS BUG, in "multitask()" we were UNCONDITIONALLY switching
      the ems page, so it would fuck up if you don't have the right
      interrupt stuff.

gt19emsg 4/19/93
    - fixed stray characters in --> Message
    - fixed rebooting problem with EMS running
    - fixed memory manager problem (was merging wrong blocks when MERGing
      DOWN )
    - added /color (reset to certain color)

gt19emsh 4/20/93
    - added "nodes_free()" to function.c, and fixed "NODES FREE" so it
      adjusts to your system "size"
    - added CAN_PRIVATE_TO_LINK_PRV,CAN_TYPE_ANSI_PRV,CAN_TYPE_FLASHING_PRV
      to limit users.
    - /RE self return echo disable/enable
    - CONSOLE #define in define.h
    - Call Back Delay "D" in /system sets delay
    - "Message END" for rotated messages

gt19emsi 4/22/93
    - global priv editor !! yeah

    - redid /m header and footer information (TITLE, and BY lines)
    - yeah! DOS hardware errors don't crash the system anymore
    - can now handle different WIDTH console text screens like 132x43
    - main menu for /user and PRIV editor is now configurable with main.prc
      files in SYSOP\ and USER\
    - ROM program now can tell if it is a console version or not
      (high bit of version number)
    - added COMPILE TIME to the program. in /SYSINFO

CURRENT_VERSION  (gt19emsh)
    - Control-C and Control-BREAK no longer affect program execution
      PAUSE is the only key which remains to be handled.
    - User can now configure Virtual Consoles regardless of the number of
      nodes liscensed.

NEED : Fix DIGIBOARD INTELLIGENT DCD bug from gt1.8b3
         - versions have been working with "chars_in_buf"
           get_first_char has not been tested since it's been
           rewritten.
