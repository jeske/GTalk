We should add modules, using dld, so that usereditor and gamecon and such
can be loaded modules, and don't have to be totally "external". At the
same time, there should be a flag which says whether the gtalk client will
fork() beforing running the module entry point. If we fork() then the 
address space is partially protected (i.e. except for the shared memory).
