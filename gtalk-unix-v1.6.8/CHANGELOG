v1.1.0 		- added pass_prompt and changed around user.c/userst.h/etc.
		- some problem with initializing the fd_sets for the common
		  data structures for nodes >74 so I reduced MAX_NODES and
		  MAX_DEVICES to 50 to deal with the problem later. Maybe
		  it is due to the increased size of "struct _node_struct"
		  from common.h now that the userdata member is bigger.
