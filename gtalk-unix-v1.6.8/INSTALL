* Compile

type "make"

It should compile cleanly on Linux systems circa RedHat 5.0...

* Create Accounts

You need to do some setup for Gtalk to work and this includes creating 
some UNIX accounts. You should create three accounts for gtalk use,
"gtsys", and "gtgst". Gtalk has a unix account for every gtalk
account. When setup correctly, it will automatically create the unix
accounts for users on gtalk. However, these two special accouts must be
setup beforehand:

gtsys: this will be the UNIX account for the gtalk sysop account #0
       Be sure to set the password, as this password will be used to
       login to the system for the first time with accout #0

gtgst: this will be the UNIX accoutn for the gtalk "guest" account. The
       password for this account will not be used by gtalk. Gtalk will
       change into this account when a guest user logs in...

You may also wish to create a "gtalk" account and change the ownership
of all the gtalk files to this account for orginization sake. This is not
required.

* Startup Gtalk

After you've done the above, su to root, go into the Targets directory, and
type "./gtalk". This should launch the gtalk server, and a few gtalk clients.
The clients will begin accepting connections on higher virtual consoles
above your normal virtual consoles. You can also telnet into gtalk on 
port 4000 (by default, you can do ./gtalk -p <port> to change the port).

* Login for the first time

When you telnet in or login on a virtual console, you should see a login
prompt like this:

|  home:~> telnet mozart 4000
|  Trying 204.94.139.92...
|  Connected to mozart.chat.net.
|  Escape character is '^]'.
|  Welcome to GTalk, Detecting ANSI...
|
|  [ ANSI Detected ]
|
|  
|  Press <RETURN> for Guest access.
|
|  User ID: _

Type "0" as your user ID and you will see this:

|  User ID: 0
|  Password: _

Type in the password that you set for the "gtsys" account above, and you
should see the following:

|  Password: .......
|  Your account has no active days!
|     Account Balance: 0cr              Overdraft Limit: 0cr
|   Spendable Credits: 0cr

|   Insufficient Credits to purchase more active days.

|  Your IP is: 204.94.139.85

You are now at the basic command prompt.... Type /? for a list of commands:

|  /?
|  Gtalk Command List

* Setting up the default classes

From here you will want to setup the basic classes, type /U, and enter
the default user edit password "jomama!" (it's currently compiled in,
this will be fixed ASAP).

|  /u
|  Enter UE Pass: .......
|
|  Useredit main menu
|
|  (N)ew User
|  (E)dit User
|  (D)elete Users
|  (U)ndelete Users
| 
|  (C)lass Edit
|  (L)ist Classes
| 
|  User Maintenance (? for Help): 

Type "C" to enter the class editor:

|  User Maintenance (? for Help): C
|
|  Class Edit
|
|  CLASS: UNKNOWN
|  CLASS: GUEST
|  CLASS: SYSOP
|  CLASS Name or Number to Edit :

Type "GUEST" to edit the GUEST class...the full screen class editor will
come up:

|   Class [N]ame   : GUEST
|   [P]riority     
|
|
|   <Time/Priorities>   <Privs>             <Misc>              <Logs>
|
|   Main           | Class Name                                | GT-CE v1.00  
|
|
|
|  -> Ctrl-W to Write, Ctrl-A to abort, Ctrl-P for previous, Ctrl-N for next <-

Hit "Ctrl-N" until "Privs" is highlighted, and then hit enter.. from here
you can edit the privileges of the GUEST account so that guests will be 
able to login.

Be sure to give them the ability to /Q or they won't be able to logout!
