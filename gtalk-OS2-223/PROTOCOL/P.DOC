1. Introduction

        This is a transfer protocol package providing Zmodem,
        Ymodem-g, Ymodem and Xmodem protocols for Bulletin Board
        Systems, Terminal programs and where ever reliable high speed
        file transfer protocols are needed.

        Package consists of two parts:

          P.DLL - A dynamic link library that contains the transfer
                  protocol routines.

          P.EXE - The front-end for P.DLL. A program that processes
                  user options and then calls the DLL to do the actual
                  transfer.
        
        During development the main goal has been achieving the maximum
        performance possible under OS/2. Not much time has been spent
        on creating a beautiful and 'friendly' user interface. If you
        aren't happy with P.EXE, you can always make your own
        front-end for the DLL.
                
        The author takes no responsibility whatsoever for any damage
        caused by P. If you decide to use this package or parts of it,
        you do it at your own risk!


2. Credits

        Chuck Forsberg for creating Zmodem and documenting it.
        Public domain sources of rzsz were used as a reference during
        the development of P.DLL.

        Ward Christensen for creating Xmodem and Ymodem.

        Gary S. Brown for the CRC calculation routines. These were
        found from the public domain rzsz sources.

	Jeffrey Altman for making the CKOP200.INI file.

        Many people who reported about bugs in the previous versions
        of P and gave me lots of new ideas.


3. Distribution policy

        P.EXE - the front-end for the DLL is distributed as public
        domain, meaning that anyone can modify and recompile the
        sources and do whatever they want with it. However, credits to
        the original author (me) would be highly appreciated but not
        required, if found so repugnant.

        P.DLL - the transfer protocol engine is distributed as
        freeware, meaning that the author (me) wants to keep his
        copyright to the program but gives everyone the right to use
        and copy it freely, without of charge.
        

4. Supported protocols and their variations

4.1 Xmodem

        This is one of the oldest transfer protocols ever. It was
        developed by Ward Christensen in 1977. It proved to be an
        excellent file transfer protocol because of its robustness and
        reasonable performance.

        The basic Xmodem used 128 byte blocks and one byte Checksum
        for error checking. There has been many extension to Xmodem
        over the years. One is CRC-16 checking and one is the use of
        1024 byte blocks. Both of these extensions are support by P
        (-alternative option and -kilo option).

4.2 Ymodem

        Ymodem is one of many extensions to Xmodem. It adds one block
        in front of every transferred file, providing file name, size
        and date information, you don't have to enter the file name at
        both ends of transmission like with Xmodem. Ymodem
        also made it possible to transfer many files with just one
        command. Ymodem uses CRC-16 as its default error checking
        method, however Checksum is still supported (-alternative
        option). P uses 128 blocks with Ymodem as the default, you
        might want to use 1024 byte blocks (-kilo option) to improve
        the throughput.

        Xmodem and Ymodem were very efficient with low speed
        connections, but due to introduction of new high speed and
        buffered modems we found that it wasn't enough.

4.3 Ymodem-g

        Ymodem-g is an extension to Ymodem protocol. All it adds is a
        continuous data transfer. Transferred blocks don't wait for
        acknowledge before transferring the next one. Ymodem-g made it
        possible to take out virtually all of the throughput provided
        by hardware. However, it had one downgrade: It didn't have any
        kind of error recovery. CRC-16 checking was still done, but in
        case of an error the transfer was simply aborted instead of
        retransmission of the broken block.

        There were also many other problems with all of the Xmodem
        derived implementations. They needed a totally transparent
        data path, making it impossible to use them over connections
        which used software flow control (XON/XOFF).

        The error recovery / speed tradeoff was also one of the main
        reasons for the development of new de facto protocol: Zmodem.

4.4 Zmodem

        Zmodem was developed by Chuck Forsberg at Omen Technology,
        Inc. in 1986. It wasn't based on the old Xmodem engine and
        that made it possible to implement many new features. The
        major feature was its possibility to send data in continuous
        stream and still recover from possible errors. Zmodem also
        introduced escaping, making it possible to transfer binary
        files over non-transparent connections.

        User convenience was also taken in consideration in
        development of Zmodem. Transmission parameters needed to be
        specified only at the one end. File name, size, and date
        information is of course also transferred, just like in
        Ymodem. Automatic start of receiving is also made possible by
        sending a ZRQINIT sequence at the beginning of the transfer,
        allowing terminal programs to monitor for it.

        Zmodem supports 32-bit CRC frame checking (frames are
        equivalent to Xmodem and Ymodem blocks) which increases the
        reliability remarkably.

        With Zmodem you don't have to transfer files right from the
        beginning in case connection was lost for some reason. Zmodem
        offers a crash recovery which you can use to continue the
        transfer from right there where it got interrupted.

        Since the late 1980s Zmodem has remained as the de facto
        transfer protocol and is still going strong.


5. Installation

        To transfer files you will need only P.EXE and P.DLL. The
        DLL will be searched from the directories on your LIBPATH and
        if not found there, it's looked up from the directory where
        your P.EXE resides.

5.1 C-Kermit

	Included in this package is file CKOP200.INI which is an
	initialization file for C-Kermit. Copy it to your C-Kermit
	directory and add the following line in your CKERMOD.INI file:

	take ckop200.ini

        Next time you'll start your C-Kermit you'll have following
        commands added to it:

        rz - Receive with Zmodem
        sz - Send with Zmodem
        ry - Receive with Ymodem
        sy - Send with Ymodem
        rg - Receive with Ymodem-g
        sg - Send with Ymodem-g
        rx - Receive with Xmodem
        sx - Send with Xmodem

        The connect type will be automatically detected and therefore
        same commands work for asynchronous, named pipe and TCP/IP
        stream socket connections.

	Check the CKOP200.INI file and change the paths and options if
        necessary.

5.2 LiveWire

        Included in this package is a file named LW_P.CMD. It is an
        OS/2 command file that is meant to be called from LiveWire.

        First, copy that LW_P.CMD to your LiveWire directory and then
        start LiveWire.

        Go to Protocol menu and choose first blank entry from the
        list. Fill the fields with following information:

        Note that you'll get the arrow pointing upwards by pressing
        CTRL-X.

        Now choose Zmodem-32 batch from the list and set the
        Auto-download to Off. From now on P's Zmodem will
        automatically start Zmodem receiving when needed.

        Other protocols are added just like but by replacing
        occurrences of "Zmodem" with the name of corresponding
        protocol: "Ymodem", "Ymodem-g" or "Xmodem". Also remember to
        remove the Auto-receive string for other protocols.

        To use P with named pipe connection you have to have separate
        protocol entries. Add protocols just like above but change the
        "async" text to "pipe" in each protocol command.

        See also LW_P.CMD if you want to change the options passed to
        P.EXE.


6. Command-line parameters of P.EXE

        When you run P.EXE without any parameters you will get an usage
        that lists all of the available options. Here they are once again,
	with detailed descriptions:

6.1 -type {async | pipe | socket}

        Select the type of communications to be used.

        async  = OS/2 Asynchronous device (RS-232C)
        pipe   = OS/2 Named pipe (Local or network)
        socket = TCP/IP stream socket

        If not specified, async will be assumed.

6.2 -device <name | path>

        Specify the name of asynchronous device (e.g. COM1), or path
        to the named pipe (e.g. \PIPE\P).

        Affects only to async and pipe communications.

6.3 -host <address>

        Internet address of host to connect to. This can be a
        resolvable name or plain IP number.

        Affects only to socket communications.

6.4 -port <port>

        Number of stream socket port to use. Choose this number to be
        big enough to not collide with other ports. See your
        TCPIP\ETC\PROTOCOLS file for reserved ports.

        Affects only to socket communications.

6.5 -server

        Specifies that we act as a server for the file transfer. We'll
        create a named pipe or stream socket and wait for a client to
        connect to it. The wait time can specified with the -wait
        option.

        Has an effect only when type of communications is pipe or socket,
        and no already open handle is available.

6.6 -wait <seconds>

        Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the client to connect to
        us. While waiting a beep can be heard every second, to disable
        the noise specify -quiet option.

        Has an effect only when acting as a server.

6.7 -share

        Open the communication device in shared mode. Specify this
        option if you can't pass a handle to P and you have to "steal"
        the communication device from a suspended process. With this
        option it is also possible to use P.EXE from a DOS program.

        Affects only to async and pipe communications, when no already open
        handle is available.

6.8 -handle <handle>

        Specifies a handle for an already open asynchronous device,
        pipe or socket. If specified and connection is asynchronous or
        pipe, the -device option should also be specified to make the
        error messages report possible errors on the correct
        device. If -device is not specified, error messages could be
        something like this:

        Failed to control device: "(null)"

        But if for example "-device com1" option was specified the
        error message would be:

        Failed to control device: "com1"

        That's all the -device option is used for when handle is
        available, therefore it's not required for transfer to work.

        For stream socket connections -host and -port option are not
        needed at all. Socket numbers are used with error messages
        instead of device name.

6.9 -loose

        If specified, the state of carrier signal will be ignored during the
        the file transfer. You might need to specify this option if
        your modem fails to maintain the state of carrier signal, or
        if you're transferring files with a null-modem cable.

        Affects only to async communications.

6.10 -telnet

        Escape telnet IAC characters and CR NUL sequences in the data stream
        and process possible incoming telnet commands. Use this option
        when you're transferring files through a telnet
        session. However, this can be used with other types of
        communication too.

6.11 -receive

        Specifies that we are receiving files.

6.12 -send

        Specifies that we are sending files.

6.13 -protocol {xmodem | ymodem | ymodem-g | zmodem}

        Specifies the transfer protocol to be used. See section 4 in
        this document for further information about the transfer
        protocols.

        If not specified, Zmodem will be assumed.

6.14 -escape {controls | minimal}

        Specify the escaping to be done during the file transfer.

        By default P escapes following characters in the data flow
        when transferring with Zmodem:

        ASCII 16        (Ctrl-P)
        ASCII 144       (Ctrl-P with 8th bit set)
        ASCII 17   (*)  (XON)
        ASCII 145  (*)  (XON with 8th bit set)
        ASCII 19   (*)  (XOFF)
        ASCII 147  (*)  (XOFF with 8th bit set)
        ASCII 24   (*)  (Ctrl-X)
        ASCII 152       (Ctrl-X with 8th bit set)

        And these if they follow an ASCII 64 ('@') or
        ASCII 192 ('@' with 8th bit set):

        ASCII 13        (Carriage return)
        ASCII 141       (Carriage return with 8th bit set)

        control - This makes us to escape all control characters
                  (ASCII 0 to 31). Escaping generates overhead by
                  transmitting two bytes to represent every control
                  character. Use it only if your connection can't pass
                  them through. 

        minimal - This makes us to escape as few characters as
                  possible so that the protocol still works with
                  standard implementations (marked with asterisks in
                  the list above).

        Affects only to Zmodem transfers.

6.15 -alternative

        Specifies that an alternative error checking method should be used.

        Here is the list of supported protocols with their default and
        alternative checking methods:

        Protocol        Default         Alternative
        --------        -------         -----------
        Zmodem          CRC-32          CRC-16
        Ymodem-g        CRC-16          N/A
        Ymodem          CRC-16          Checksum
        Xmodem          Checksum        CRC-16

        See the following sections for detailed information about the
        checking methods.

        This option has no meaning when sending files with Ymodem-g,
        Ymodem or Xmodem, it is up to the receiver to choose the error
        checking method to be used.

6.15.1 CRC-32

        32-bit CRC is the most effective error checking method
        supported by P. It's based on a 32-bit number (4 bytes)
        calculated with a polynomial specified by ANSI X3.66
        specification.

        This 32-bit number is calculated by the sender and
        transferred with every 1024 (or less) bytes. The receiver does
        the same calculation on received data and if the results
        are different the data is requested to be sent again. The
        probability of garbled data getting through is practically
        nil.

6.15.2 CRC-16

        This is based on a 16-bit number (2 bytes) calculated with a
        similar polynomial to one used with 32-bit CRC. The
        probability of garbled data getting through is much higher
        than with CRC-32, but it's still very very small.

6.15.3 Checksum

        This an ancient checking method used by the first versions of
        Xmodem. It's based on a 8-bit (1 byte) number calculated from
        transferred data by summing up all bytes in it.

        For example, Checksum of three bytes: 'a' (ASCII decimal 97),
        'b' (ASCII decimal 98) and 'c' (ASCII decimal 99) is '&'
        (ASCII decimal 38). It comes from 97 + 98 + 99 = 294 saved in
        8-bit number, which cuts it to 38.

        With Checksum checking the probability of garbled data getting
        acknowledged is relatively high, so whenever possible you
        should use CRC-16 instead. 

6.16 -kilo

        If specified, 1024 byte blocks will be used instead of default
        128 byte. This speeds up the transfer considerably on high
        speed connections. However, the probability of garbled data
        getting through grows when there is more data to calculate the
        check value from, thus you should avoid using 1024 byte blocks
        with Checksum checking.

        Affects only to Ymodem-g, Ymodem and Xmodem sending, when
        receiving it's up to the sender to define the block size.

6.17 -window <bytes>

        Specifies the size of transfer window to be used. Valid range is
        from 256 to 65472, and the size must be a multiple of 64.

        By specifying a window size you make P to wait for acknowledge
        from the remote for every <bytes> transferred, when the
        default is sending data in full streaming, without any
        acknowledges.

        Using this option might be necessary if you're sending data through a
        network where some nodes might timeout if data isn't
        transferred to one direction for a certain time.

        Using a small window size slows down the transfer somewhat.

        Affects only to Zmodem transfers.

6.18 -automatic

        Specifies that we should send a string "rz" followed by a carriage
        return to the remote before starting the transfer. If there's
        an UNIX shell running at the other end it will be interpreted
        as the user has just typed "rz" and then pressed enter, and
        the UNIX rz program will be run.

        If you're not transferring files to an UNIX system this option
        just generates more garbage to remote screen at the
        initialization phase, in case it hasn't started the receiving
        program yet.

        Affects only to Zmodem sending.

6.19 -serial

        If specified, the serial number of the remote will we queried and
        displayed. This option is meant for informational purposes
        only.

        Affects only to Zmodem sending.

6.20 -attention <string>

        Specifies an attention string that will be sent when receiving
        files with Zmodem and you would like to get the attention of the
        sender. 

        Following characters have a special meaning in the attention string:

        ASCII 221 -- Break signal
        ASCII 222 -- One second pause

6.21 -commbufs <bytes>

        Specifies the size of both, input and output communication buffer.
        Default is 2048 bytes.

        Specifying a bigger buffer has an effect only to protocols
        sending and receiving data in continuous streams: Zmodem and
        Ymodem-g.

        With a bigger buffer and a reliable connection you can speed up
        the throughput considerably. But if the connection requires
        retransmits, a big buffer can slow down the throughput much
        more and generate a lot of annoying garbage to the remote
        screen if the transfer gets cancelled.

        For example if you specify 32768 bytes long buffers, we will
        block in read or write routines until all data is read or
        written. If you're sending with Zmodem and there is an error
        in transmission, it won't be recovered until all data in the
        buffers is transferred. And if you're using Ymodem-g the
        transfer will be aborted in case of an error, all data in
        buffers will be written to the remote screen until we
        recognize the abortion.

        And when receiving with Zmodem or Ymodem-g, we won't check for
        possible transmission errors until whole buffer is received,
        making it possible for us to transfer a lot of data that's to
        be resent.

        There's no maximum limit for the buffer sizes. The bigger you
        specify the more memory will be eaten. Under multitasking
        environments like OS/2, with bigger buffers a bit less
        processor time will be consumed during the transfer.

6.22 -comminbuf <bytes>

        Specifies explicitly the size of communication input
        buffer. See -commbufs option for further information.

6.23 -commoutbuf <bytes>
 
        Specifies explicitly the size of communication output
        buffer. See -commbufs option for further information.

6.24 -filebuf <bytes>

        Specifies the size of file read and write buffer. If not specified,
        no internal file buffering will be done.

        By specifying a bigger file buffer it is possible to speed up
        considerably file transfers to or from slow media, like
        CD-ROMs or floppy drives.

        It's also possible to send contents of a floppy without needing
        to keep it in the drive all the time. Just specify big enough
        buffer for files to be sent and all data will be read into
        memory in the beginning of the transfer and send from there.

        Transfers using an asynchronous device (cps < 10000) are not
        likely to benefit from a bigger file buffer, but if the
        communication device is either named pipe or stream socket,
        bigger buffer is most likely to improve the throughput.

        There's no maximum limit for the size of file buffer, you
        could even transfer contents of a whole hard drive if you
        wanted to (and had enough memory for the buffer).

        The optimal buffer size is best found by experimenting. You
        could start for example by specifying a 32k byte buffer and
        compare the CPSs to what you get without a buffer at all.

6.25 -speed <bps>

        Specifies the throughput speed in bits per second. This
        value will be used only to calculate the transfer time
        estimates. If not specified or <bps> is 0, time estimates
        will not be shown.

6.26 -mileage

        If specified, the number of files and bytes left to transfer
        (and estimated time) is displayed before each file.

        Affects only to batch transfers and works only when receiving
        and the sender provides such information.

6.27 -options

        If specified, the conversion, management and transport options
        received from the sender will be shown on the screen in a
        verbal form. This option is meant mainly to aid problem
        determination.

        Affects only to Zmodem receiving.

6.28 -headers

        Specifies that received Zmodem headers and their contents
        should be shown on the screen in a verbal form during the
        transfer. This option is meant mainly to aid problem
        determination.

        Affects only to Zmodem transfers.

6.29 -frameends

        Specifies that received Zmodem frame ends should be shown on
        the screen in verbal form during the transfer. This option is
        meant mainly to aid problem determination. 

        Affects only to Zmodem transfers.

6.30 -quiet

        Do not beep after the file transfer and when acting as a communication
        server and waiting for a client to connect to us.

6.31 -priority <class> <delta>

        Specifies the priority of file transfer process.

        Valid values for priority class are:

        0 - No class change
        1 - Idle-time
        2 - Regular
        3 - Time-critical
        4 - Server

        Priority delta can be any value in range of -31 to 31.

        You might want to specify a higher priority for the file
        transfer process if you are running simultaneously something
        that is consuming lot of CPU time, like playing DOS games, etc.

        Lower priority might come into consideration if you're
        transferring files on the background and don't want the
        foreground process to get effected by the transfer.

6.32 -dszlog <path>

        If specified, a DSZ compatible log about files transferred
        will be created in the file pointed by the <path>. This option
        is essential for most of the Bulletin Board Systems.

6.33 -pause

        Wait for a key press after the transfer, before exiting. This
        option might became useful if you're using P.EXE as an
        external protocol provider for some software that clears the
        screen after we exit. By clearing the screen it prevents the
        user from reading the messages displayed by P.EXE at the end
        of the transfer.

6.34 -directory <directory>

        Specifies the directory where received files are to be saved.
        If not specified, files will be saved to the current
        directory. Directory path can be trailed by a backslash or not.

6.35 -paths

        Do not strip drive and directory components from the file
        paths sent and received.

        Be careful with this option if you're receiving files, it
        would be possible for the other end to send files to any drive
        and directory on your system.

        Has no meaning to Xmodem transfers.

6.36 -create

        If specified, non-existing directory structures will be
        created.

        Has meaning only when receiving files and -paths option is
        specified.

6.37 -clean

        Delete files from failed transfers. If specified, transfers cannot
        be resumed later on. This option is useful for keeping your
        disks clean from garbage files.

6.38 -touch

        If specified, the date information received with files will be
        ignored. The date of received files will correspond to the
        time of transfer.

6.39 -recursive

        If specified, files specified on the command-line are searched
        recursively, making it possible to send contents of whole
        directory structure.

        Affects only to Zmodem, Ymodem-g and Ymodem sending.

6.40 -text

        If specified, a text conversion will be done on received and sent
        files. Meaning that CR LF line end sequences will be
        translated to the convention used by the remote system and
        vice versa.

        Note that this option should be used only when transferring
        text files.

        With Zmodem, this option is passed also to the remote at the
        initialization phase.

6.41 -resume

        Specifies that we should try to resume aborted file transfers
        i.e. when file already exists and its size is smaller than the
        size of the new file.

        With Zmodem, this option is passed also to the remote at the
        initialization phase.

        Affects only to Zmodem transfers.

6.42 -existing

        If specified, no new files will be created. Only the already
        existing files will be updated or re-transferred.

        With Zmodem, this option is passed also to the remote at the
        initialization phase.

6.43 -update

        If specified, already existing files will be replaced only if the
        new file is longer or newer.

        With Zmodem, this option is passed also to the remote at the
        initialization phase.

6.44 -append

        If specified, already existing files will get the new data appended
        to them.

        With Zmodem, this option is passed also to the remote at the
        initialization phase.

6.45 -replace

        If specified, already existing files will be replaced by the new
        ones.

        With Zmodem, this option is passed also to the remote at the
        initialization phase.

6.46 -newer

        If specified, already existing files will be replaced only if the
        new one has a later date.

        With Zmodem, this option is passed also to the remote at the
        initialization phase.

6.47 -different

        If specified, already existing files will be replaced only if
        dates or lengths are different.

        With Zmodem, this option is passed also to the remote at the
        initialization phase.

6.48 -protect

        If specified, already existing files won't be replaced at any
        situation.

        With Zmodem, this option is passed also to the remote at the
        initialization phase.

6.49 -rename

        If specified, files will be renamed if one with an identical name
        already exists.

        With Zmodem, this option is passed also to the remote at the
        initialization phase.

6.50 [<file> | <@listfile> ...]

        The rest of the command-line is for paths to files to be sent
        or received. If you have a lot of files to transfer you might
        want to use a listfile instead of specifying them all on the
        command-line. Listfiles are plain ASCII files containing file
        paths on separate lines.

        Listfiles are distinguished from the normal file paths on the
        command-line by the preceding '@' character. You can mix up
        any number of paths and listfiles on the command-line.

        Either backslash ('\') or slash ('/') characters can be used
        as a directory and name separator.

        If the name of first file to be transferred begins with a
        character '-', it should be preceded by a plain '-' separated
        by space from the last option and this file name.

        When sending files, the use of these file paths is obvious,
        those files are to be sent. If the file specified can't be
        opened, either it doesn't exist or it's being used by some
        another application, it will be skipped.

        You can specify any number of files to be transferred with
        protocols that support batch transmissions, that is all but
        Xmodem. With Xmodem you can specify only one file, whether you
        are receiving or sending.

        When receiving with a protocol supporting batch transfers you
        don't have to specify any files at all. However, if you do,
        only those files specified will be received. If you are
        receiving with Zmodem, the files not found on the command-line
        will be skipped. With Ymodem, the transfer will be aborted,
        because the protocol does not support skipping.


7. Using P.DLL with your own applications

        The whole protocol engine itself resides in P.DLL. P.EXE only
        acts as a front-end. Anyone can use the DLL with their
        application to provide file transfer protocols. User interface
        is not limited anyway, the calling program can be either PM
        based or plain VIO text application.

        P.DLL can be linked to your application by using an import
        library or by dynamically loading and freeing the library when
        needed. For more information about import libraries see your C
        compiler's manual or IMPLIB section of OS/2 Toolkit's Tools
        Reference. No import library is included in this distribution,
        you have to create one from the DLL with IMPLIB or similar
        utility.

        P.DLL has only one entry function: p_transfer(). A pointer to a
        configuration structure is passed as a parameter to the entry
        function. The configuration structure contains transfer
        parameters and pointers to callback functions which are used
        to give information about the progress of the transfer back to
        the calling application, and to handle files being
        transferred. For detailed description of the configuration
        structure and callback functions see P.H header file in the
        "exesrc" directory.

        The best way to get hold of it is probably by studying the
        sources of P.EXE, especially callback.c.
